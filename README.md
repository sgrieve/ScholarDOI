## ScholarDOI
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

A simple Google Chrome extension that uses the crossref API and [doi2bib](https://doi2bib.org) to provide 1 click access to bibtex files which contain a DOI.

This is still quite rough and ready - it works for my purposes but this represents the first Chrome extension I have written so it is probably full of mistakes.

## Requirements

- JQuery 3.4.0
- Chrome 73.0

## Installation

Clone or download this repo and put the folder somewhere you can find it. To install a custom extension in Chrome follow the instructions in [this guide](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension):

> To load your extension in Chrome, open up chrome://extensions/ in your browser and click “Developer mode” in the top right. Now click “Load unpacked extension…” and select the extension’s directory. You should now see your extension in the list.


## Contributing
